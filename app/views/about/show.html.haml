        Hack Week:
        %small
          Innovate, collaborate, and learn.
    %p.lead
      In its history, Hack Week has incubated software like the
      = link_to 'openSUSE ARM port,', 'https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM'
      which gave life to a few SUSE products. It has also launched
      projects that benefited the entire free free software ecosystem like
      = link_to 'Inqlude', "https://inqlude.org/"
      (a Qt library archive) and come up with solutions like
      = link_to 'Jangouts', 'https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts'
      , the open source video conferencing tool developed  by our engineers
      to scratch their own itch. What are you going to add to this collection?

    %h3 Innovate
    %p
      Use this opportunity to work on any activity of your passion. You decide
      whether you contribute to
      = link_to projects_path(@episode) do
        an existing Hack Week project
      or explore strange new languages. You choose whether you seek out new
      tools and new communities, or boldly go where no hacker has gone before!
      Just
      = link_to 'record your ideas,', new_project_path
      about what people could hack on in this tool.
    %p
      And be open-minded, supportive, and respectful. Hack Week is a happy and
      constructive place. Support ideas you like, ignore ideas you don't like.
      Help improve the ideas of others and accept help to improve the ideas of
      your own. Hack Week is about discourse and open discussion. Please
      approach innovation with an open mind, respect, and the desire to support your
      fellow hackers!

    %h3 Collaborate
    %p
      We encourage you to find like-minded developers and team up to multiply
      your hacking power. Use the opportunity to work with people from other
      teams, departments or locations. Get together in an office and make use of
      all the nice things the Internet provides to collaborate remotely.
    %p
      Remember: we are an open company, and work transparently on free software.
      Share your code on the platform of your choice, and reference it from your
      project. Then let the community and the rest of the world know about what
      you are doing. Blog, tweet, publish videos, shout it from the roof tops so
      people can pick up your project, copy, distribute, study, change and
      improve it!

    %h3 Learn
    %p
      Hack Week is also the time to share new tricks: offer yours and pick some up
      from others. Use this week to expand your horizon and maybe even crack the
      books. Acquire new information, reinforce what you know, adapt your
      behavior and expand your skills!

    %h3.text-success And don't forget to have a lot of fun ...
