<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Extend the existing tools we have for creating Linux OS images (KIWI) to be able to create a customized "Linux Desktop on a stick".</p>
<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ul>
<li>The image should be easy to update, either via (preferably Delta-)RPM packages or, if this is easier to do, by "re-flashing" the whole image.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If the "re-flashing" approach is used, only the delta between the existing image and the new image should have to be downloaded to the stick.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The image should be as small as possible to leave room for data on the stick. Target should be a 1-2 GB USB Flash memory stick.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>User data must survive stick software updates.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The solution should be as secure as possible. E.g., it would be good if the read-only parts of the stick would only be readable for software updates (in a maintenance mode or so).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Wear of the flash memory should be minimized (e.g. by using an appropriate file system).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Obviously, the stick must be bootable on systems that support booting from USB.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional steps (not needed in a first iteration)</h3>
<ul>
<li>If possible, memory resources on the PC/laptop the stick is booted should be used. E.g. the stick Linux could make use of a harddisk partition that is not used/explicitly configured for use with the stick to cache data. The assumption would be that no personal data should be left on the HD, so the HD needs to either be cleaned up when the stick Linux is shut down or data has to be securely encrypted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There should be a tool to create personalized sticks from a generic image, e.g. based on an LDAP directory with user data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>Joachim Werner originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
<p>This could get pretty big, so maybe the focus for the hackfest should just be on the first steps.</p>
<p>Jiaju Zhang is going to work on this project in HackWeek.</p>
<p>Guanjun He is going to work on this project in HackWeek.</p>
