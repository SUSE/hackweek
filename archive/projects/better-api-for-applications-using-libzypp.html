        <h1>Better API for applications using libzypp</h1>

        <p><b>Tags:</b> Idea, Libzypp, YaST, HelpWanted, HW-Hacker</p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Currently libzypp does not offer (or offers only very limited scope of) high-level functions 
        for common package (patch, pattern) operations such as 'list all patterns','list packages
        that belong to a pattern' 'list all objects fulfilling certain criteria' etc. </p>
        <p>If an application (such as UI library, zypper etc.) wants to use libzypp, it needs to implement
        these functions by itself. As a result, the same functionality is (in better case) implemented by the code that is copy-pasted n times between n applications, or (in worse case) implemented inconsistently in n different ways.</p>
        <p>The idea is to design API that would
        1) make libzypp functionality easily accesible to the applications by offering simple functions 
        returning data types convenient for the application
        2) implement these functions once only (in libzypp or in a shared library over libzypp) so that
        applications can simply call them and do not have to care about libzypp implementation details</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Katarina Machalkova originated this idea.  </p>
        <p>Authors of applications using libzypp (HuHa - yast2-qt, Michael Meeks, Ricardo Cruz -yast2-gtk, Jano Kupec - zypper) might be interested as well</p>
        <p>Katarina Machalkova would like to start with going through the code of y2-ncurses and y2-qt, to identify 
        code consisting of libzypp functions only and evaluate which of this could be possibly moved to libzypp 
        (a wrapper library over libzypp respectively). </p>
        <p>The next step will be to suggest suitable prototypes for these 'to-be-moved' functions so that they are
        conveniently handled by UI library.</p>
        <p>Help of libzypp hackers wanted!</p>
        <p>Jano Kupec is planning to implement part of this idea (see comments).</p>
