<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Wireless routers etc. typically come with a web administration frontend.
To build something similar based on SUSE, we'd need to create a framework to expose
configuration stuff; one could build on PHP (like FreeNAS), perl/cgi, TurboGears,
ZOPE, Ruby on Rails, or even .net(mono) or Java technologies.</p>
<p>Rather than doing this, the idea is to reuse the comprehensive existing knowledge and
abstraction of system configuration that we have already: YaST.</p>
<p>YaST has a remote capability using VNC -- but this is //not// the goal; rather native
web (HTML/CSS) technology should be used.</p>
<p>The way YaST was designed, it actually already abstracts the user interface from the
logic behind; a form / dialogue is described using a tree syntax (in YCP), which
one of the frontends (qt, ncurses, gtk) then displays and sends the values that
the user has filled in back. This transactional nature and the limited widget set
(how can you be more restricted than ncurses?)
make it possible to do it via HTML/CSS with forms. Not even fancy AJAX Web2.0pre
technology is needed.</p>
<p>So the idea is to create a yast2-frontend-httpd, which serves dialogue pages.</p>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>Get the frontend to implement every widget, so that every YaST module works in
the web mode. Create a start page that implements the functionality of the YaST
Control Center. Demo all this!</p>
<h3>Bonus ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use https (but don't use port 443 by default)</li>
<li>Keep a list of people that are authorized to authenticate and use this service</li>
<li>Keep a list of modules that a user may use (subset of existing YaST modules)</li>
<li>Possibly even further ideas how to control the access on even finer granularity</li>
<li>Rather than using thttpd or apache, see whether a few lines in perl or python or ruby won't be the easier solution to implement the web server (the https protocol)</li>
<li>Along the way, create a tool to actually convert the YCP based dialog tree description to XML; this way, using the existing language bindings in YaST, there's no need for someone to learn YCP.</li>
<li>Use stylesheets, so the thing can be themed.</li>
<li>If we get bored and are done by Wednesday, let's look into reviving the web-updater to also have a restricted web package manager.</li>
</ul>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>Kurt Garloff originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
<p>Joachim Werner is interested in this idea.
Klaus Kaempf can give input to this.</p>
<p>Someone from the YaST team plus someone who is familiar with web technology should be able
to implement this.</p>
