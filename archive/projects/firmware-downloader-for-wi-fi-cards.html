        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Many modern wi-fi cards need a firmware. Unfortunately, most of firmware images are under license that doesn't allow redistribution, so we cannot make a RPM with them.</p>
        <p>To solve that, some Linux drivers have a tool for extracting firmware from a Windows driver or downloading it from a predefined set of locations. That's not ideal as you need a different tool for different hardware and automated tools (like YaST) can not reliably use it.</p>
        <p>It would be nice to have a tool, that either scans for available wi-fi cards or is given a particular PCI or USB ID and for each card:
          * Report a name of driver required for this card,</p>
        <p>  * report that the card doesn't need a firmware, or</p>
        <p>  * report the name(s) of firmware image(s) required,</p>
        <p>  * with appropriate command line option, the attempt to download and install firmware is made,</p>
        <p>  * with another option, a description how to get and install firmware is displayed.</p>
        <p>The output should be usable by tools like YaST.</p>
        <p>This can greatly improve user experience when installing wi-fi cards with YaST or similar tools.</p>

        <p>Jiri Benc originated this idea and is able to give advices if needed.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
