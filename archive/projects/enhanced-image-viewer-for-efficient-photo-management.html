<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Use cases:</p>
<p>Vlada engage in macro photography. He needs
to take several tries of each subject and wants to select the best ones.</p>
<p>Vlada wants to have his photos in best possible quality, therefore
he shots to RAW format. He wants to have most of his photos automatically 
converted to JPEG. He wants to convert selected files manually.</p>
<p>Vlada uses a set of scripts for sorting photos, which uses symlinks and MD5s
He can't use move/delete/comment functions of ordinary viewer, because
it would break the structure maintained by scripts or at least the MD5s.</p>
<p>Vlada wants to burn parts of his collection on CDs and/or copy it to external
hard disc. That breaks meta-information maintained by ordinary viewers.</p>
<p>Petr collect photos from various events from his camera and also the photos 
from friends. He wants to see the photos on time-line and also compensate
time offsets in various cameras, to have displayed the pictures in correct order.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>1. sorting photos according to quality and selecting best shots:</p>
<ul>
<li>comparison of both composition and technical quality (noise, DOF, histogram) side by side, optional connected scrolling</li>
<li>mark photos for deletion, actually delete them at the end of session</li>
</ul>
<p>2. tagging and commenting photos</p>
<ul>
<li>tags and comments are stored using open standards (EXIF)</li>
</ul>
<p>3. handling of raw format</p>
<ul>
<li>possibilities: RAW with embeded JPEG, RAW + JPEG from camera, RAW + JPEG generated later</li>
<li>in most cases it is not necessary to show RAW preview if JPEG with the same name exists</li>
<li>correct file (RAW or JPEG, configurable) to external programs (ufraw)</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Interoperability</p>
<ul>
<li>images can be acessed and modified by arbitrary software</li>
<li>directory/file oriented</li>
<li>no information is primarily stored outside image files</li>
<li>possibility to overload write access methods by external programs / scripts</li>
<li>almost all image modifications should be done by external programs</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation</p>
<p>Enhance gqview</p>
<ul>
<li>already implemented features are near to requirements</li>
<li>gtk programming is easier for us</li>
</ul>
