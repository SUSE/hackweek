        <h2>Description</h2>
        <richtext>
              <p>We have some old hardware (like an old main board, RAM memory, VGA cards etc ). 
        We would like to use them for creating: aquarium OpenSuse machine :
        It is workstation witch is install in an aquarium and in stand of water there is a pure mineral oil (it looks like water but it doesn't el. stream)</p>
              <p>this will be similar to his machine:

                <p>It would be even cooler to have fish in the aquarium ;) I suppose normal fish would not last long but we could find a way to fit LCD in there and fish could be at least on the LCD ;).</p>

                <p>Plastic or rubber fish would be more realistic and cheaper.</p>
                <p>Can't wait to see this in action :D</p>

                  It is very old idea, TPC Jicin's company did it 17 years ago on INVEX exhibition, company used silicon oil for this trick. TPC had whole PC, CRT monitor and open hard disk inside aquarium. Vlada Nadvornik saw it in shop window in Jicin.   
        10 years ago Mironet company improved such idea and prepare aquarium for INVEX exhibition with PC, real fishes, water weeds (see
                  <a href="http://www.diit.cz/data/images/thumb/1292_2b9e5e4fbd.jpg?1251214910">photo1</a>
                  and
                  <a href="http://www.diit.cz/data/images/thumb/1291_2b9e5e4fbd.jpg?1251214910">photo2</a>
                  ). It was not a joke, pc really worked and fishes some time nibbled RAM and PCI bus ;). Mironet's solution was probably a hack for a short exhibition time only , because visitors saw corrosion of metal parts, but Mironet didn't tell how it was prepared. Aquarium with fishes and PC is old idea but a real challenge :).

                <p>I don't really see the reason for making this a feature request, although it is a cool idea.</p>
