        <h2>Description</h2>
        <richtext>
              <p>OpenSuSE currently ships a fairly dated PCP package (2.5.0).&#xA0; It would be nice if a more modern</p>
              <p>version of PCP was included.&#xA0; Version 3.0.0 has just been released by the community.&#xA0; Part of</p>
              <p>the effort to move from 2.9.x to 3.0 was to update some of the packaging to split the libraries out of</p>
              <p>the core package and to create various -devel packages.</p>

                <p>Current source tarballs build very easily on opensuse. pcp-gui has a lot of nice features that pcpmon (which seems mostly</p>
                <p>abandoned by it's developer) lacks.</p>

                <p>For tracking, the openSUSE packaging done during hackweek is available from:
        https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Admdiss%3Abranches%3Apcp-hw6</p>
                <p>A few things I'd like to get done before submitting to Factory:
        - spec file cleanups; the install script leaves a few holes in the manifest files
        - use the correct icon for pcp-gui
        - fix qassistantclient.h build dependency for Factory build (provided by libqt4-devel-4.6.3 in 11.3 and qt4-assistant-adp-devel in Factory)</p>

                <p>pcp-gui and updated (3.5.8) pcp packages are now included in the openSUSE:Factory build service project for inclusion in the next release branch.</p>

                <p>Wonderful! We make a great deal of use of this in our prod environment, and it'll be good to be able to stop compiling our own 3.x rpm's : )</p>
