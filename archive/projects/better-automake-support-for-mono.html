        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>[[http://www.gnu.org/software/automake|Automake]] is a widely used tool that assists with writing Makefiles.  It already has support for building native executables, libraries, and shared libraries written in C, C++, Fortran, etc., and also has support for Java class libraries.</p>
        <p>It would be useful to add support to Automake for building and linking .NET assemblies, and to support installation into the GAC.</p>
        <p>Existing mono based projects like gtk# and f-spot have evolved a rules.make to help them with the task.  However, it would be better to have native Automake support for mono/.NET.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Raja R Harinath originated this idea, and worked on it during the Hack Week.</p>

        <p>The code is available as a series of [[http://blog.hurrynot.org/mono-in-automake/patches|patches]] to Automake  (packed conveniently in a [[http://blog.hurrynot.org/mono-in-automake/patches.tar.gz|tarball]]), and there's also an [[http://blog.hurrynot.org/mono-in-automake/test-1.0.tar.gz|example project]] that shows how to use it.</p>
        <p>Features implemented include:</p>
        <p>  * various kinds of assemblies and modules: .exe, .dll, .netmodule
          * automatic handling of $(srcdir) when invoking compilers
          * support for C#, VB, Nemerle, and Boo
          * very easily extensible to other .NET languages
          * support for installing DLLs to the GAC
          * basic autoconf macro for detecting presence of compilers
          * has documentation!!!!</p>
        <p>Todo</p>
        <p>  * use it in real life and find out what's missing, and what's awkward
          * make autoconf support more extensive: maybe add support for checking if some assemblies are present or not</p>
