        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Our current YaST printer setup module shows its age:
        It was enhanced from what we had before CUPS
        (lprold/apsfilter, LPRng/lpdfilter),
        then when both CUPS and LPRng/lpdfilter were supported,
        up to now when only CUPS is supported.
        Currently the YaST printer setup tool somehow works o.k.
        but its usability is not really good.</p>
        <p>When I tested the KDE printer setup tool, the Gnome printer setup tool,
        and the CUPS web frontend, all do somehow work o.k. but the usability
        is also not really good.</p>
        <p>I think that the common usability problem is that all printer setup tools
        ask the user for a reasonable set of parameters to set up a print queue
        but as far as I see it looks obscure for an unexperienced user
        what there is really going on "behind the scenes".</p>
        <p>I think what is missing in the current printer setup tools
        from the usability point of view is to provide a thoroughly honest
        and truthfully view to the user what there is really going on.</p>
        <p>There are already some ideas about "YaST2 Printer UI enhancement", see
        http://en.opensuse.org/YaST/Printer</p>
        <p>I don't have only "UI enhancement" in mind.</p>
        <p>What I have in mind is a completely new design from scratch
        which is focussed on usability.</p>
