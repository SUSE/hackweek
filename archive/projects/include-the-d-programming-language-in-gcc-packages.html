<h2>Description</h2>
<p>D is an object-oriented, imperative, multiparadigm system programming language by Walter Bright of Digital Mars. It originated as a re-engineering of C++, but even though it is predominantly influenced by that language, it is not a variant of C++. D has redesigned some C++ features and has been influenced by concepts used in other programming languages, such as Java, C# and Eiffel. A stable version, 1.0, was released on January 2, 2007.</p>
<p>gcc needs to be compiled with this language enabled, so it is not straighforward to package it. t would be better to add the source to the SUSE package and split a gcc-d from there.</p>
<p>Including D language in our gcc would allow more people to try it.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>Duncan Mac-Vicar originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
