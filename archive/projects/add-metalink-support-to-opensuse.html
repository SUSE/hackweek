        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Metalinks">Metalink</a> is an Open Standard that bundles the various ways (FTP/HTTP/P2P) to get files into one format for easier downloads. This makes it good for downloading ISOs; particularly for people who can't use P2P because of restrictions from their ISP or University. It can deliver very fast download speeds since most clients support multiple connections to multiple mirrors, automatically. It's good for servers since it evens out the downloads between other servers, and it's great for the user because it means they don't have to hunt down a fast mirror. It's also a more reliable download method because Metalinks have support for hash pieces. </p>
        <p>Although there are <a href="http://metalinker.org/implementation.html">quite a few clients</a> supporting Metalinks already, wget and kget (KDE's download manager) support are in the works. It would be nice though if openSUSE was ahead of the game on this one and had Metalink support for downloading its ISOs already. We had a small trial run with these at 10.2 time and there were 60,000 metalink downloads in three days. Many very happy customers (and Metalinks have increasingly improved since then). </p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Francis Giannaros originated this idea and is interested in helping implement it.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).</p>
