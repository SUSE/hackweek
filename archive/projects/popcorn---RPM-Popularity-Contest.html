        <h2>Description</h2>
        <richtext>
              <p>Popcorn wants to become a service similar to Debian's popcon. It would track the packages and repositories that subscribed users have installed on their (for now) RPM distribution.</p>
              <p>http://gitorious.org/opensuse/popcorn</p>
              <p>https://github.com/mapleoin/popcorn</p>
              <p>Popcorn consists of a command line client written in Python and a server (python-tornado and redis currently). The Client is almost completely functional, but the server is in an experimental state.</p>
              <p>I would like to work on the server side to bring it into a usable state. The database "schema" has to become stable (right now some objects are mapped over calls to redis). This needs to be documented.</p>
              <p>Ideally some work could be done for the WebUI as well. There are many ways that the project as a whole could grow afterward: adding integration with OBS to know how many users each package/repository has, support for different distributions, integration with smolt.</p>
              <p>Looking for volunteers who want to work on any part of this project or add new ones (e.g. gamification?).</p>
