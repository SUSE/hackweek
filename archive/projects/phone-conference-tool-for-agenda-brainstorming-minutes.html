        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>vym (view your mind) is a QT based application for mindmapping. It is used for collecting and sorting ideas, brainstorming, planning and learning.</p>
        <p>It would be cool if several users e.g. in a telephone conference could see and maybe even modify a mindmap simultanously, kind of creating a network shared whiteboard.</p>
        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>Uwe Drechsel originated this idea and will be working on this. Hints how to best do the network communication are appreciated (vym is somewhat scriptable already).</p>
        <h2>Related Materials</h2>
        <p>* [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/vym/|vym on sourceforge]] Source code is in the CVS there</p>
        <h2>Status</h2>
        <p>A vym instance can now connect via network as client to another vym running as server. The client duplicates all actions performed on the server. This even works cross platform: A client running in Mac OSX duplicates an openSUSE server: openSUSE rules ;-)</p>
        <p>Not meant for production yet, e.g. the clients currently should not be allowed to modify their represntation of the map. At least not without sending the changes back to the server. The CVS version already has the network code, but server address is hardcoded right now. More convenient dialogs will follow in a couple of days.</p>
        <p>The screenshot below shows two vym instances, the right one doubling the actions of the left one:
