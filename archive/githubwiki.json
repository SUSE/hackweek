The overview is meant to concentrate information that are not available or are on many places and difficult to find. I hope to get most of the interesting information technical as well as about processes to as small area as possible.\n\nThe target audience is\n\n* HR/training,\n* hackers,\n* salesman,\n* managers\n* and, well, just whoever can make some use of this.\n\n#### Main requirements\n\n* **Compact**\n* **Complete**\n* **Connected**\n* **Centralized**\n\n### Scope\nOne of the important factors is to keep the guide simple and usable for new employees so people will not get scared as soon as they see it for the first time.\n\nScope has been qualified as follows: the content will have references or descriptions to products, teams, tools and acronyms.\n\n### Format\nCreated documentation will be available on the Novell wiki. There is also possibility that a presentation will be created that will serve the most important stuff from the wiki. That is now considered a bonus of the project.\n\nI have settled with the table format because that is immediately easy to understand and follow. And even with a lot of data it does not look scary.\n\n## Status\n\nThe project is proposed and agreed on with manager and HR department.\n\n\n\n\n## Related material\nYou can find the guide at the link below. So far there is only a skeleton and I am working on the data gathering and also redefining the structure.

So the plan is allow Connect users to rate and review packages in software.o-o, so search results can be ordered by rating, number of comments, etc. We should also have 'latest commented/rated' widgets for Connect, to encourage participation.\n\nThe page should act also as an [Open Collaboration Services](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/open-collaboration-services-1.5) provider, allowing other applications to access to comments and ratings. OCS is the protocol suggested by the [AppStream initiative](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Distributions/AppStream/), so this project will add another piece to the AppStream puzzle, closing a little bit the gap between what we really have now and the final AppStream goal.\n\n## Status\n\nCurrently, software.o-o is a Ruby on Rails application which performs packages searches using the OBS API, sorts this result using its own relevance criteria, enriches the information using data from the appdata.xml file from openSUSE repository and, finally, shows the results.\n\nTo add comments and ratings to the mix, some things need to be done:\n\n* Add tests to ensure that the current functionality is not broken during the process.\n* Add authentication support to software.o-o through the authentication proxy (the same used by connect.o-o).\n* Add comments and ratings to the application.\n* Add options to sort by relevance, ratings or comments (explore the possibility of using [Xapian](http://xapian.org)).\n* Implement the OCS interface.\n* Implement widgets for connect.o-o ([Elgg](http://elgg.org) plugin).\n* A lot of UI design work (help needed!)\n* ...\n\nAncor Gonzalez Sosa plans to work on this project.\n\nA lot of things to do for a week (and no previous experience with OCS, Xapian, Elgg...) so there is room for a lot of contributors.\n\n\n## Related material\n\n* [Source Code](http://github.com/openSUSE/software-o-o)\n\n## Comments\n",

      "description": "The goal of this project is to create an admin dashboard for managing nodes in a cluster. It's currently focused on the specific use case of managing the [SUSE Studio](http://susestudio.com/) cluster, but we hope that it will be generic enough to be useful for others as well. The dashboard will pull key information/metrics from other systems and also allow us to store/track metadata, such as comments, warranty information, etc.\n\nWe want to the user interface to be responsive, intuitive, and easy to use - like these [admin templates](https://wrapbootstrap.com/themes/admin).\n\n### Background\nOperating a cluster of servers in a data center today often requires a myriad array of software tools, each specialized for solving a specific purpose. For example, Nagios/Icinga for monitoring, Munin/Ganglia for system metrics, NewRelic for application runtime performance metrics, Graphite for business metrics, Puppet/Chef for configuration management, LogStash/GrayLog2 for logging, etc. \n\nWhile it's great to have such a wide variety of open source tools to pick and choose from, there's a lack of good open source dashboards that pulls in key information _and_ allows us to perform actions/comments with the nodes/data. (If you know of any, do drop us a note in the comments section below.) \n\nWe're also missing a nice way to track and visualize miscellaneous types of information like hardware failures, physical location (datacenter/cluster/rack/unit), comments, and warranty information. This is all managed with a Google Spreadsheet at the moment, which is not that nice.\n\n### Plan for Phase 1\nThe first phase of the project will be completed within the Hackweek (5 days). We will focus on replacing the Google spreadsheet for tracking node information, and implement a web dashboard that displays a table with similar information. The Studio cluster is managed by Chef, so we'll pull and persist relevant data there. This brings the following advantages:\n\n* Node/host information will be pulled directly from Chef, so there's no longer a need to manually enter and update entries, which is slow, error-prone, and easily outdated.\n* Clear history on the comments - we will store who changed what and when.\n\nWe don't plan to replace the Chef web UI, so we won't duplicate functionality there. \n\nTo keep things simple, we will store all comments in Chef. Alternative backends may be provided in future if this does not scale, or if some other configuration management framework is preferred.\n\n### Technology / Frameworks\nDue to team experience and usage in other related projects (eg. Studio itself), our preferred stack is Rails, HAML, SASS, CoffeeScript, Rspec, Batman JS and PostgreSQL.\n\n## Status\n\nDaily summary of our activities, as documentation on why we made certain decisions, in case there's a need to revisit them in future:\n\n| Date | Comments |\n|------|----------|\n| Mon 8 Apr 13 | We've started brainstorming and gathering feedback on the proposed use cases and scope. Talked to Jan Krupa and Wolfgang Engel (Studio sysadmins) on the use cases and setup details (running it within the firewall vs externally, say on Heroku). Design sketches and possible implementations ideas made. Also got the internal Chef web UI running (link to internal documentation in the reference section below). |\n| Tue 9 Apr 13 | After some research, discussions, and alignment our various goals for this Hackweek project, we decided to use [Team Dashboard](https://github.com/fdietz/team_dashboard) as a starting point. We'll upstream relevant patches but our project has fundamentally different goals so we'll have to see how to move forward down the road. Ancor will focus on the frontend and James on the backend.

You can still use HTML docs which doesn't collide.\n* it seems that latest EFL release (1.7.6) doesn't contain some examples anymore - adjusted spec file accordingly\n* Fixed ev desktop file not to fail for SLE targets\n* E17 0.17.1 still contains e-module-ibox.edj bug which prevents me from creating working openSUSE profile for now - I hope it will get better with 0.17.2 which is to be built\n* UDisks added as Recommends into spec file, it is not colliding with UDisks2, no UDisks2 support planned for E17 (which depends on e_dbus v1)\n\n<!---\nAdd comments here.

FWIW the notes I have from that experiment are: Mostly seems to work, except sometimes an openstack compute node (\"outer KVM guest\", I guess you'd call it) locks up a CPU when running an instance (\"inner KVM guest\"), and gets stuck there. The next day you discover that node thinks it's the year 2190, and has some exciting large numbers in syslog, e.g.: \"Clocksource tsc unstable (delta = -848253070989 ns)\" and \"BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 15589s! [qemu-kvm:7190]\". No idea if this affects SP3, just recording it for posterity :-)\n\n*by Dinar Valeev*: We are running OBS workers using KVM on PowerPC in HV mode for quite a while. To be able to run HV mode you need JS21 (PPC970) with SLOF firmware or PowerLinux 7R2 machine (POWER7) running in OPAL mode. From a year of usage, I can say it is quite stable.

Most of the operations and filters are written in Jinja templating language that is used to generate specialized code in C programming language. Creating code that works with less usual pixel types should be as easy as adding pixel definition into the configuration and rebuilding the library.\n\nSome of the features are:\n\n* Supports loading and saving most of the image formats (PNG, JPG; loading only: GIF, BMP, PSP, ...)\n* Can draw lines/circles/polygons (anti aliased drawing is being worked on)\n* Has image filters (resampling, convolutions, point filters, ditherings, ...) some supports running in multiple threads\n* Drawing and input support for X11 (with support for multiple windows), SDL, Linux Framebuffer, kernel input layer\n* Text drawing with compiled-in fonts or TTF fonts using FreeType\n* (not finished) Python bindings\n* Has number of unit tests\n\nThere are still some [nits](https://github.com/gfxprim/gfxprim/wiki/Scratchpad) to be taken care of.

      "description": "\nIf factory devel projects submit larger updates, they create easily 100 or 200 submit requests that\nonly make sense to be integrated into factory at once.\n\nThe problem is that 200 submit requests are 200 legal reviews (some automatic, some manual), 200 source reviews (all manual), 200 install checks (automatic). But only once these 600 reviews are through, it makes sense to integrate them into factory.\n\nThis currently means the release manager (coolo :) needs to know the state of the reviews of all the packages before he can continue. This is goes wrong more often than it works.\n\n## Status\n\nI talked to Mls and Adrian about it so far and my idea is to support a grouping\nrequest type which acts as hidden review step for all requests presented in the group.\n\nExample: devel project K submits package a and b and they only make sense together.\nWith only two packages, you can use the multi action support of OBS requests, which means the reviewers always have to review two packages at once. This works for manual reviews with 2 packages, but the automatic tools do not support this at all (which we could fix).\n\nIf a and b get 198 sisters, it gets *really* problematic for all involved parties with multi actions. Especially as solving one problem means updating one package, means creating a new request - throwing away all reviews (who are bound to the request id in the database).\n\nWith a grouping request (the name is not yet decided :), you would do 200 submit requests, that have 3x200 reviews as now - and one additional request who wouldn't be become new unless the 600 reviews are accepted. And if you need to update one package later on, you need to create a new SR, supersede the old SR and osc can then prompt something like \"SR 99 was part of group request 100, do you want to supersede that too?\" Y? created 102 superseding SR 98 in group request 100 with SR 99.\n\nOne additional benefit is that the repo-checker can actually work on all packages at the same time, avoiding the problem we have now that evolution SR is uninstallable unless libgweather is the same in factory as in gnome project.\n\n\n## Related material\n\n* [OBS Source Code](http://github.com/openSUSE/build-service)\n\n## Comments\n\nAdrian dislikes me disliking multi action requests, but I have to live with that. Everyone but adrian dislikes multi action requests :)\n\n## TODO list\n\n* [X] define use cases and exepcted behaviour (stay away from cucumber though:)\n* [ ] API code and test cases\n* [ ] Webui code and test cases\n* [ ] osc code (optional as long as osc api works)\n\n## Use cases\n\nTerms: \"group request\" == a request of type \"group\", \"subrequest\" == \"a request of a different type, but contained in a group\"\n\n* Define a group of 2+ existant requests as group. If one of them has an open review, the whole group is in review (including the subrequests). Group requests are not valid as subrequest.\n* Add a request to a group. If the new request is in review, the whole group is in review (including the subrequests).\n* Declining/Revoking a group request. All subrequests with no open review, become new (they are single again).\n* Accepting a group request. All subrequests are accepted in one go (this of course requires to have rights to accept all of them).\n* Accepting/Revoking a subrequest. The request is removed from the group - if the other requests are without open reviews, the group turns to new\n* Replace a subrequest. Adding and removing requests should be possible within groups, direct replacing not. So replacing should work as add a new request ID and removing an old one. All tracked as history elements.\n* Superseding a subrequest. This acts like replacing \n* Accepting a review in a subrequest will make the complete group turn to new if it's the last review and only then.\n* Declining a review or the complete subrequest will not remove the request from the group, but will leave the whole group in review till the subrequest is superseded or revoked - or the group is edited in another way.\n* Especially while superseding group requests, it needs to be perfectly valid to have subrequests as part of  2 (or more) group requests.\n\n## API code\n\nThe biggest challenge is the current state of the request code in the API - the request controller is by far the most complex code in the API (and an aweful example of spagetthi code)\n\nhttps://codeclimate.com/github/openSUSE/open-build-service/RequestController rates the overall complexity with 3514, the limit for grade F is 200!\n\nSo this needed to be unpuzzled before I can add further features and took almost two days - https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/236/files - 28 changed files with 1,350 additions and 1,190 deletions.\n",

I listed the most preferred features\nof current snoek as follows, with estimation effort appended in each\nitem.\n\n* Make activities editing as consistent as the creating page (approx 1 day)\n\n* Email automation (1.5 day)\n    - Allow manual password reset when forgetting it (1 day)\n    - Send mail to encourage user vote when an activity is about to\n      expired. (1.5 day)\n\n* General UI (1 day)\n\n    - Allow the activity deadline set to precision of minutes (0.5 day)\n    - Display the total vote number in the activity display page (0.3 day)\n    - Display activity creation date/time in front page (0.2 day)\n\n* Adding privacy setting (approx 2 days)\n\n    - Allow vote sponsor hide the overall results from UI\n    - Allow creating anonymous vote\n\n* \"Who vote for what\" page improvement (2 days)\n\n    - Currently we have every votes shown as seperate tables. It would be\n      nice to have an alternative view that show all the votes in a single\n      table. \n\n    - Populate 'Who vote for what' table to odf file as well (basically\n      expand the function of \"Download Me\" button)\n\n* Use Novell LDAP authentication (approx 3 days)\n\n* Allow to create activity that allows vote among a specific range of\n  users, groups (approx 3 days)\n    - We do not support group at all, this needs to be implemented\n      before the real feature.\n\n* Rich text editor (approx 3 days)\n    - Support richer text area for activity descriptions and vote\n      questions. Allow add links to questions in activity creating\n      phase.\n    - We need to do particular research to embed a proper JQUERY rich\n      text editor, then probably do some tiny hack of the backend to\n      support text formatting storage. Finally get the results export\n      to html smoothly.\n\n* A better solution when removing question (not sure...since I didn't\n  recognize an ideal solution yet)\n  \n    - The current mechanism removed all of the votes of a question in\n      a activity when modifying a question. One possible way to\n      improve is when edit an activity's question item, we should\n      allow the activity creater choosing to remove related vote or\n      not.\n\n## Status\n\n<!---\nDescribe status of idea or project.

[Full article](http://somethingsinistral.net/blog/configuration-management-as-legos/).\n\nThe goal of this Hack Week project is to gather a few third-party modules, and test them for SLE and openSUSE. That way we can have a number of base modules, that are ready for constructing services and roles on top of them. Most of the good modules are written by PuppetLabs or their operations team. The problem is that most of the modules on forge have minimal to no openSUSE support, due to the fact that PuppetLabs operations are using Debian in their boxes. The good part though is that PuppetLabs is very cooperative in accepting patches, so ideally we will need to work on those modules and submit our patches upstream.\n\nList of Puppet modules for hacking:\n\n* [https://github.com/puppetlabs-operations/puppet-puppet](https://github.com/puppetlabs-operations/puppet-puppet): Module to deploy and manage the Puppet Master and the Puppet Agents.

It is a skeleton Akonadi resource and the build system to build SOAP bindings using KDSoap.  The stumbling block is that KD Soap does not properly support inheritance in SOAP interfaces yet.  I discovered this at last year's PIM meeting, KDAB are working on it now, but the implementation is still incomplete.  David Faure, the author, is going to be here for the cross desktop hackathon from Thursday through Tuesday.  But unless he has nearly solved this problem, I think a resource using a different SOAP stack might be the most realistic way to proceed this week.  This is the current state of inheritance support in KDSoap as described by David:\n\n\"On Monday 04 March 2013 21:49:41 Will Stephenson wrote:\n> https://github.com/KDAB/KDSoap/commit/d7699cf7818fc8bb80ceadc16f928906579bb7\n> 01\n>\n> Hey, where was my CCMAIL? \n\nHehe, well, it was never truly finished....\nIn fact, it still isn't.\n\nWe discovered this afterwards:\n\nClass hierarchies work when they are the direct argument of the method being \ncalled.

Unfortunately it can only run on Ubuntu hosts right now.\nMoreover there are just two types of containers out there: one based on Ubuntu, the other based on Fedora.\n\n## Status\n[Flavio Castelli](https://github.com/flavio) is hacking on it.\n\n### Day 1: achievements\n\nI've been able to build and run docker.io on an openSUSE 12.3 host machine.\nI'm also able to execute all the the [examples](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/examples) reported on docker.io website. That means running a ubuntu-based containers :)\n\nTomorrow I'll clean up all the \"ugly\" hacks I had to do in order to get lxc work properly. The plan is to improve the lxc package and build a docker.io one on [OBS](http://build.opensuse.org).\n\n### Day 2: achievements\nPackaged `go-pty`, a build-time dependency of docker and created docker package which provides docker binary and its init script.\n\nFor some strange reason container's networking is not working as expected. This is probably due to the change of the default bridge interface from `lxcbr0` to `docker0`. The init script takes care of creating this bridge interface, but the containers keep complaining because they cannot attach to the device.\n\nPlans for tomorrow:\n  * figure out what is wrong with the networking interface used by the containers.\n  * small cleanup of docker.spec.\n  * push docker package to OBS inside of home:flavio_castelli:docker.\n  * extend docker to create its pid file to a file, required by the init script.\n\n### Day 3: achievements\n\nMorning:\n  * **[DONE]** figure out what is wrong with the networking interface used by the containers.\n  * **[DONE]** small cleanup of docker.spec.\n  * **[DONE]** push docker package to OBS inside of home:flavio_castelli:docker.\n  * **[DONE]** extend docker to create its pid file to a file, required by the init script.\n\nAfternoon:\n  * publish a demo appliance created with SUSE Studio appliance\n  * figure out how to crate a openSUSE-based container.\n\n\n## Related material\n* [the future of Linux Containers talk](http://www.youtube.com/embed/wW9CAH9nSLs)\n* docker.io's [examples](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/examples/)\n\n## Comments\n\nHi @flavio! This is great and I know it will make several people very happy in the Docker community :) I created an issue on the Docker repo to track your progress and help you communicate with anyone else who might want to participate: https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/issues/359\n\nThanks again!\nSolomon\n<hr/>",

It will make access to internet resources easy, such as dictionaries, wikipedia, weather, maps etc. It will utilize cloud services where useful.\nConfigurations are possible, but only doable by the \"supervizor\" or administrator in pre Productivity Desktop speach.\n\nCustomizing the standard KDE deskop or utilizing the RazorQt Desktop will be a good starting point.\n\n## Status\n\n<!---\nDescribe status of idea or project.

As the cycle was shorter than normal, there are a few\nwrinkles that need to be ironed out and also a whole heap of new\nthings that can be added. After some discussion at FOSDEM, it was\ndecided to hold a Hackathon to address these items. The Hackathon will\ntake place on 08 to 12 April, both at the SUSE offices in Nuremberg as\nwell as online for those that can't attend in person.\n\nWe have a long TODO list:\n\n* AArch64 fixes for 12.3 & Factory\n* Build openSUSE 12.3 for Raspberry Pi\n* Resolve outstanding 12.3 ARM Image issues\n* Release 12.3 images\n* Create OpenStack images for ARM\n* Setup KVM capable hardware as workers for external build service\n* Build OBS Worker image for armv7l\n* Setup emulator hardware for AArch64\n* Get Xen on Chromebook & Arndale running\n* Tune OBS for more optimized ARM builds\n\nThere will also be the opportunity for new device bring up for those\nthat want to, but our intention is to work through and complete as\nmuch of the above TODO list as possible first. For those interested in\njoining in the fun, please either join us in Nuremberg and/or join the\n[opensuse-arm mailing list][1], the [#opensuse-arm IRC channel on\nFreenode][2] and also keep an eye on the [openSUSE on ARM Trello\nboard][3].

But now, they said that my board will ship within two weeks, definitely after hackweek...\n\nmeanwhile, i want to try to add opensuse support for cubieboard(based on Allwinner A10 SOC). Allwinner A10 has good support on kernel 3.0, i am not sure whether i could run opensuse 12.3 on kenel 3.0, if not i need to update the kernel then learn how to use kiwi generate the image.\n\n*by Max Lin*\n\nDavid Chang and me have CuBox in our hand, since we alreay have openSUSE 12.3 CuBox JeOS image, this hackweek, we'll try to build XFCE image(kiwi) and packaging xorg-dovefb video driver(compatible with 12.3 kernel) on CuBox.
