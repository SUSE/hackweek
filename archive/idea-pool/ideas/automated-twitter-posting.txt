{{tag>Idea Desktop SLED openSUSE HelpWanted Personality twitter}}

===== Description =====
More and more people are joining the Twitter community. They are all out there telling us what they are doing?

Are they telling the truth?

It would be interesting to explore if creating an automated applet for our desktop could not introduce honest posts on Twitter. Have the system tell what it thinks we are doing (Sending emails, Talking on IM, Away from keyboard, Browsing the web, ...). This could be a step in having the system showing how much it can figure out about its users.




===== People =====
/* People working on this, interested people, knowledgeable people.  Also put your HelpWanted requests in here. */
Guy Lunardi originated this idea. In order for this idea to go anywhere, someone will need to take the lead on it please. It's up for grab! Much help requested for this idea.

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
