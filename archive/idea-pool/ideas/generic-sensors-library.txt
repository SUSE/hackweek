===== Description =====
libsensors was designed a long time ago, and starts showing its age. Back then there was no standard kernel/user-space interface so the library had to know the specifics of every hardware monitoring driver. With Linux 2.6 and sysfs, we've defined a mostly standard kernel/user-space interface, so it should be possible to write a new libsensors that would be completely generic. Unfortunately, nobody took the time to work seriously on this. There was an attempt by students from Netherlands several months ago, but it was more like a proof of concept that is nowhere next to a releasable state.

I can see at least 4 major advantages in having a generic libsensors:
  - Users wouldn't have to upgrade to the very latest version of libsensors to get support for new hardware. Upgrading the kernel would be enough.
  - Graphical front-ends displaying sensors value would no longer need to be updated each time a new version of libsensors is released.
  - The maintenance work on libsensors would drop to virtually zero, freeing resources for more interesting development work.
  - The library would be much smaller. Right now the library weights over 300 kB (on x86_64) and keeps growing with every new supported device.

===== People =====
/* This section is for listing all of the people involved in this idea or project:
  - The originator(s) of the idea
  - Interested people who might later help out with implementing this idea
  - Experts or knowledgeable people who could give advice about this idea

If you are already working on this project, and you need help, you can use one of the  HelpWanted tags to say so, and then write some specific details about the kinds of help that you need here. */

Jean Delvare originated this idea, and will be working on it.

===== Related Materials =====
/* Links, mockups, screen captures, files. */
There is a separate branch upstream for this project:

http://www.lm-sensors.org/browser/lm-sensors/branches/lm-sensors-3.0.0

I plan to build openSuse 10.2 packages on Friday (June 29th) with whatever I will have come up with. Testers will be welcome.

===== Side Quests =====

As the new libsensors will not be compatible with the previous one, and will only support Linux 2.6, I believe it's the right time to clean up a number of things in the lm-sensors package. This includes:
  * Moving the i2c tools to a separate package.
  * Removing some compatibility code.

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
