<h1>Hack Week HOWTO</h1>

<p>How to do Hack Week? A guide for starters.</p>

<h2>Do what you want, but do it.</h2>

<p>Hack Week is the opportunity for all SUSE engineers to work on projects of
their passion. You choose, if you contribute to an existing open source project,
work on openSUSE, or try something new, nobody has tried before. Innovate,
collaborate, and learn.</p>

<p>Enter your ideas in the <a href="index.html#projects">project Wiki</a>, and
update the information there, while working on the project. So others can
follow, and maybe join. Browse the Wiki for ideas and inspiration. Find
like-minded developers and team up to multiply your hacking power.</p>

<p>Please also add ideas, if you don't know or plan to work on it, when you
think it would be great, if somebody else would pick it up.</p>

<h2>Collaborate</h2>

<p>We encourage you to team up with like-minded developers to work on projects
jointly. Take the opportunity to work with people from other teams or from the
community. Get together at an office, make use of all the nice things the
Internet provides us to collaborate remotely. Don't hesitate to ask others, and
be open when being asked. If you need any support to enable and improve
collaboration feel free to contact the Hack Week coordination team.</p>

<h2>Spread the word</h2>

<p>We are an open company, and work transparently on open source code. Share
your code on the platform of your choice, and reference it from the project
Wiki.</p>

<p>Let your colleagues, the community, and the rest of world know about what
you are doing. Blog, tweet, publish videos, shout to your neighbour on the
other side of the street. So people can pick up your project, use it, give
feedback, contribute, or join.</p>

<h2>Be open-minded, supportive, and respectful</h2>

<p>Hack Week is a happy and constructive place. Support ideas you like, ignore
ideas you don't like. Help to improve ideas of others, and accept help to
improve your own. We encourage discourse and open discussion, but make sure that
you approach it with and open mind, respect, and the desire to support. And
don't forget to have a lot of fun ...</p>
